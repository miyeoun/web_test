<span style="font-weight:bold;">JavaScript is a programming language that developers use to make interactive webpages. 
 From refreshing social media feeds to displaying animations and interactive maps, 
 JavaScript functions can improve a website's user experience. As a client-side scripting language, 
 it is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. For example, when browsing the internet, 
 anytime you see an image carousel, a click-to-show dropdown menu, or dynamically changing element colors on a webpage, 
 you see the effects of JavaScript.</p>
